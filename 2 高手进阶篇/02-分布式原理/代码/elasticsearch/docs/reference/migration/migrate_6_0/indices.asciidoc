=== Templates changes

==== `template` is now `index_patterns`

Previously templates expressed the indices that they should match using a glob
style pattern in the `template` field. They should now use the `index_patterns`
field instead. As the name implies you can define multiple glob style patterns
in an array but for convenience defining a single pattern as a bare string is
also supported. So both of these examples are valid:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _template/template_1
{
  "index_patterns": ["te*", "bar*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1
  }
}
PUT _template/template_2
{
  "index_patterns": "te*",
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE


=== Shadow Replicas are deprecated

<<indices-shadow-replicas,Shadow Replicas>> don't see much usage and we are planning to remove them.
