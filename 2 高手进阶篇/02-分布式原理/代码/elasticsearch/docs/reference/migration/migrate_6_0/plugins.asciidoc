=== Plugins changes

==== Mapper attachments plugin

* The mapper attachments plugin has been deprecated in elasticsearch 5.0 and is now removed.
You can use {plugins}/ingest-attachment.html[ingest attachment plugin] instead.

==== S3 Repository plugin

* The bucket an s3 repository is configured with will no longer be created automatically.
It must exist before the s3 repository is created.

* Support for specifying s3 credentials through environment variables and
system properties has been removed. Use the `elasticsearch-keystore` tool
to securely store the credentials.

* Specifying region has been removed. This includes the settings `cloud.aws.region`,
`cloud.aws.s3.region`, `repositories.s3.region`, and specifying
region inside the repository settings. Instead, specify the full endpoint if a custom
s3 location is needed, or rely on the default behavior which automatically locates
the region of the configured bucket.

==== Azure Repository plugin

* The container an azure repository is configured with will no longer be created automatically.
It must exist before the azure repository is created.
