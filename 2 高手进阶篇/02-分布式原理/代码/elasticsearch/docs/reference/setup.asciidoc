[[supported-platforms]]
[float]
== Supported platforms

The matrix of officially supported operating systems and JVMs is available here:
link:/support/matrix[Support Matrix].  Elasticsearch is tested on the listed
platforms, but it is possible that it will work on other platforms too.

[float]
[[jvm-version]]
== Java (JVM) Version

Elasticsearch is built using Java, and requires at least
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 8] in
order to run. Only Oracle's Java and the OpenJDK are supported. The same JVM
version should be used on all Elasticsearch nodes and clients.

We recommend installing Java version *{jdk} or later*. Elasticsearch will
refuse to start if a known-bad version of Java is used.

The version of Java that Elasticsearch will use can be configured by setting
the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

NOTE: Elasticsearch ships with default configuration for running Elasticsearch on 64-bit server JVMs. If you are using a 32-bit client JVM,
you must remove `-server` from <<jvm-options,jvm.options>> and if you are using any 32-bit JVM you should reconfigure the thread stack size
from `-Xss1m` to `-Xss320k`.
